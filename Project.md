# Project Scope for BYJU's Clone

## **Project Scope:**

This project aims to develop a mobile and web application similar to BYJU's, which provides online educational services for students, including live classes, video lessons, quizzes, and learning progress tracking. The app will cater to multiple user roles such as students, parents, and teachers, offering features like course enrollment, live classes, assessments, and payment processing.

The app will allow users to browse and enroll in a variety of courses, attend live sessions, track learning progress, interact with instructors, and make payments for course enrollment. Administrators will have full control over the platform, with features to manage users, courses, and track performance. Teachers will be able to conduct live sessions, manage course content, and track student progress.

The app will be designed to provide an intuitive, user-friendly experience, ensuring easy navigation for both students and instructors. It will also support real-time notifications and customer support features to assist users during their learning journey.

## **Methodologies:**

### 1. **Agile Development:**
- The project will follow an **Agile** methodology to ensure flexibility and rapid iterations. We will work in sprints (2-4 weeks) and deliver incremental updates for review and testing.
- The development team will regularly hold **stand-up meetings**, sprint planning, and sprint reviews to ensure transparent communication and quick problem resolution.

### 2. **Test-Driven Development (TDD):**
- We will implement **TDD** practices to ensure the highest code quality. Unit and integration tests will be written before implementing features, ensuring that the product meets functional and non-functional requirements.

### 3. **User-Centered Design (UCD):**
- The design will focus on providing a **user-friendly experience**. **Wireframes** and **prototypes** will be created for both mobile and web platforms, followed by user testing to refine usability.
- The app will be optimized for both **students** and **teachers** to provide an intuitive, easy-to-navigate interface.

### 4. **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):**
- The project will implement **CI/CD pipelines** to ensure smooth code integration and faster delivery cycles. This will help in maintaining code quality while deploying new features efficiently.

### 5. **Security Best Practices:**
- **Data security** will be a priority, and industry-standard encryption will be used to protect sensitive data, such as payment information and user credentials.
- **OAuth 2.0** and **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens) will be implemented for secure authentication and authorization.

### 6. **Scalable Architecture:**
- The backend will be designed using a **microservices architecture**, allowing the application to scale efficiently as user demand grows. Services will be containerized using **Docker** and managed with orchestration tools like **Kubernetes**.
